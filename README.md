To run a demo of the application, you can create a MongoDB Atlas configuration (usually the easiest way). After creating a cluster through Atlas, click Connect > Choose Connection Method > Drivers > Copy Link, then paste this connection link in place of the existing `MONGO_URL` string in the `.env` file. Make sure to enter the password you set for your server in place of the `<db_password>` section of the connection string. After entering `npm run start` in the terminal (connect through the `localhost:port` using port specified in the terminal log).
